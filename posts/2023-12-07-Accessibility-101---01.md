In my previous post, I mentioned that I'll improve my skills related to Web Development and I decided to start with Accessibility (aka A11y).
I started watching the series about [freeCodeCamp - Accessibility Quiz][yt-series] which follows 50 steps to learn more about A11y. I plan
to watch the video, take some notes, write down some thoughts, and apply some concepts in my blog post.

# Steps 1-10

* `lang` attribute for `html` tag

```html
<html lang='en'></html>
```

Fortunately, we already have this attribute defined in our `html` tag.

* `meta` tag and define `charset` attribute

```html
<meta charset='UTF-8' />
```

* `meta` tag and define `viewport` with the `content` attribute

* `meta` tag and define `description` attribute

* `title` tag to understand the content of a page

* Use semantic HTML elements (e.g. `header`, `nav`, `main`, etc.)


Those tips are useful but in the video we never got to the point of actually using a screen reader that will use the metadata provided.
After all, we included all of these tags, attributes, and values so that they could help end users to navigate easily through the site.
Are we really completing that goal?
