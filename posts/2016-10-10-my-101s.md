## What is your 101?
It's a template with a lot of problems that I've chosen to learn about any new
programming language that I want.

The template is [here](https://gist.github.com/CristhianMotoche/85c4f6cdafc23ee92df0bb6ff65ab1be).
Take a look and give me your feedback. I'll really apreciate it. :)
