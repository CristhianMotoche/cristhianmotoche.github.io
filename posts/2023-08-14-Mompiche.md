description: My vacations from last weekend
---

I wanted to go with my mom to Decameron so that she can have some vacations and rest.
She deserved it! We planned to go there a year ago and for many inconveniences we could go earlier.
My sister joined us and the three of us decided to go during the holidays of the independence day (August 10th).

It was a long trip because of traffic. People love going to the beach and that
caused the trip to take almost 9 hours. I saw the beautiful landscape, rest a little bit,
and read a book in that long trip.

The place was cool, the weather was nice, and people was friendly. We danced,
swam, walked around the beach, drank, ate (a lot), sang, played games, relax,
and bought a subscription. Yeah, I'm not sure if made the right decision with that last one.
We plan to use that subscription to go to Argentina, so if I write about that then
you'll know if that was a good idea.

The 3 nights and 2 days went by so fast that we didn't notice. The trip back
home was long too because everyone was coming back to the city. This time I slept
a lot and I watched a couple of movies about dogs that were projected in the bus.
I remember the dog's names very well: Buck (The Call of the wild) and 
Clifford (Clifford the big red dog). I got two lessons from those movies:

- You'll go through a lot of things (good and bad) to find a place where you're really you.
Your instincts will guide you. Just like Buck went through to find his place in the forest.

- It's okay to be different. We all are and we found people that love us the way we are.
Just like Emily and Cliff were different from others and they were appreciated by their loved ones.

In conclusion, the vacations were good and dogs are nice. :P

Until a next time!
