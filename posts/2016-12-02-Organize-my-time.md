# Introduction
If you ever had problems with your tasks and sometimes you find yourself doing nothing,
this guide might help you. I've had this kind of problems my whole life. I'm a student
of Systems Engineering and I've learnt a few things about managing proyects and I
realized that I can use that to manage tasks in my life. Do you wanna know how?
Let's continue reading! :D

# Workflow
My workflow is a top down approach based on time: year -> month -> week -> day -> hour.

## First step: Define your *year* goals
Start by defining the goals that you want to achieve for the following year. For instance,
if you were a musician, you might want to play in a concert for many people; if you were
a soccer player, you might want to be the best player in your team; if you were a programmer (like me), you
might want to be better at a new programming language; if you were in a new relationship,
you might want to enjoy a really good time with your partner. There are many examples!
You should define what you really want to achive.

You might have noticed all the goals in the examples are very general and that is fine.
You will specify all your goals by months, weeks, days and hours!

**Suggestion:** I always try to define like 10 goals by year and I try to be a little
real. Defining my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
([personal SWOT analysis] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis)) I know
what can and should do. My goals are diverse so that I can improve like a profesional, like a
person, and every role I have in my life.

## Second step: Map your goals into *months*
Ok, now I need that you specify your goals. I'll explain this using every example above.
- If you were a musician and you want to play in a concert to many people:
  - Write a album
  - ...
- If you were a soccer player and you want to be the best in your team:
  - Improve your statistics
  - ...
- If you were a programmer and you want yo be better at a new programming language:
  - Start a new project in that programming language
  - ...
- If you were in a relationship and you want to enjoy a really good time with your partner:
  - Plan a trip to some romantic place
  - ...

Once you have more specific goals map them into the months of the year:

| January | Objective 1 | Objective 2 |
| Februay | Objective 1 | Objective 8 |
| March | Objective 1 | Objective 4 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| December | Objective (n-1) | Objective n |

Some goals will need more time than others so you could define to do one or more
of them per month. Perhaps, you will define one goal for two or more months. It
depends on you. The purpouse of this is that you can concentrate your body and mind in
those specific goals.

The next step is to split that goal into tasks that you can complete by week.

**Suggestion:** I don't set more than two objectives to do per month, because
there are some tasks that appear in the week and I need to solve them too,

## Third step: Specify your deliverables for this *week*
## Fourth step: What are you going to do *today*?
## Fifth step: What task are you going to do in this *hours*?

# Conclusion
