description: How I will change the actual state of my blog post in a new one.

# Introduction
I dislike the current state of my Blog Post Web Site for the following reasons:

- The favicon looks like a white square with some lines on it.
- It needs to follow some of the current styles for Web sites.
- The logo needs to be displayed in a different way.
- Some blog posts are empty entries. I need to fill or remove them.
- The font is small.
- Needs to follow some colour combination.
- Looks weird on mobiles.
- ...

For these reasons I'm going to refactor it. I'll try to get the best quality of
it.

That is the first question. What quality means? It certanly has a very general
meaning. Accordingly, to the [ISO 9000][quality], quality is:


> Degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirement.

I've already listed my requirements, so now the question is which characteristics
will fulfils them? First, I'll let you know that the World Wide Web Consorcium (W3C)
has a page with the [specifications of quality][https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality]
for a Web site. And it provides some tools that I'll talk a little bit latter.
However, the W3C has some specifications that don't fulfil all my requirements.
Like, favicon standars, image displaying, fonts, and so on.
