# List of tips
The following list shows all the tips to improve my productivity that I've heard
and sometimes I've tried. I'll tell you what I think about them and what was my
experience. Finally, I'll give you a list of the tools that I used to follow a
particular tip.

NOTE: This is a continuous list, so this blog post might look different the second
time you take a look at it.

## Tips:

- **52/17**. This method says that you should be focus in your work for 52 minutes
and rest for 17 minutes. I didn't try this tip, because I think it is an exageration
of the rest time. I know that having a time to relax is really important, but 17 min.
might be a lot. For instance, if you work for 104 min. you would have rest 34 min.
And if you work for 208 min. you would have rest 64 min. If you do that in your job,
you might get a memo, well I think so. You could try it, though. Some experts says
that it is the optimal time to be really productive.

- **Pomodoro**. Pomodoro is a method really similar to **52/17**. However, the time
is different: 25 minutes to work and 5 min to rest. I've used this one, and I think
is really good. However, the only problem that I have with this method is that
sometimes I forgot to reload a sesion. That is terrible, because I end up doing
resting more than 5 minutes. I'd say that this is great technique, but you need
to be really self-disciplined.

## Tools:
- **52/17**. You can use any timer. For example: [egg timer](http://e.ggtimer.com/).
- **Pomodoro**. You can use any timer. For example: [egg timer](http://e.ggtimer.com/) or Goodtime
for your phone.
