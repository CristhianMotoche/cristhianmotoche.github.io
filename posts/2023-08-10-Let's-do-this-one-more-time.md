Okay, let's do this one last time, shall we?

My name is Cristhian Motoche. I'm a software developer from Ecuador and I've
been doing that for a long time now. I've always wanted to keep this blog post
alive and write as much as I can but I just never had the chance.

My last blog post was around 3 years ago and I haven't writen anything here ever since.

A lot of things have happened in my life since then. Some things were good, others
bad, others very bad, and others very good. Life is like that, you know? You
never know what is going to happen next and you just have to _bite the bullet_.
Many things are comming up and I'll try to be ready for them.

Hopefully, this time I'll write more often. I don't know if you'll find something
interesting here but I plan to keep writing as much as I can for myself!

**NOTE:** I started this post with the phrase "Let's do this one last time"
because it reminded me of [the phrase from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie][let-s-do-it-one-more-time]
and it was similar to the way I come back every now and then to write in this
blog post.

Finally, here is another phrase from that movie:

> _I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff. But, I can. Anyone can wear the mask.
> You could weark the mask. If you didnt' know that before. I hope you do now._ (Miles Morales, 2018).
