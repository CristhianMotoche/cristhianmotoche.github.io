A few days ago, Stack Builders celebrated its 10th Anniversary in Ecuador. 
The event was truly memorable and I had a great time socializing with my colleagues,
enjoying the lively music and delicious food, and receiving thoughtful gifts, among other highlights.
Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy to the fullest because my tummy hurted due to
something I ate during lunch. This incident taught me a valuable lesson: it is
important to exercise caution when consuming unfamiliar food, particularly if 
it contains fish, in a restaurant where the preparation methods are unknown.
As one of my dear colleagues wisely pointed out, "Have you ever seen Kitchen Nightmares?
You never know how your food is prepared!". I don't want to blame the people
that prepared the food or the administration because I'm not Gordon Ramsay.
Running a business and cooking can be very complicated so I won't critize the
restaurant.

The after party was awesome, too! Although, I slept most of the party (again, tummy ache) but it was
cool to see everybody so happy and having fun. Also, Tumbaco is very nice in the
mornings. I'm very happy to be part of this amazing team. Hopefully, I can
celebrate my 10th anniversary in this company some years in the future.
