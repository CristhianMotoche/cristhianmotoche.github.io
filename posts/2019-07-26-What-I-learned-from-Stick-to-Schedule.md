# Productivity Habits That Stick

I like this course, because the mentor started explaining what is productivity,
from his perspective:

```
productivity = intention + attention
```

**Intention.-** The things that drive you, list them.
**Attention.-** Focus on the things that are on your list. Do the right things at the
right time.

> Approach first, act second.

# Applyting both of them to my daily life
There are many things that have my intento and attention right now:

- Guitar
- Health
- Foreign language
- Soft skills
- Tech skills

# Awareness
Know about your _intentions_ and beign in touch with them. So that you can put
more _attention_ to them.

How to build awareness?
## Capture relentlessly
> Capture everything, regret nothing.
Clarity.- Put what's in your mind in some place that you trust. As often, as you can.

## Slow down
Grab a sheet of paper and just capture your thoughts. Brainstorm.

> Speed the right things up, and slow the right things down.
