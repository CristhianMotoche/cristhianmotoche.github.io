# Course #1: Project Management in Real Life

Here are some of the things I learned from this course:

## 1) Set S.M.A.R.T. Goals
All your goals need to be SMART:

- **S**pecific
- **M**esurable
- **A**chivable
- **R**ealistic
- **T*ime bounded

## 2) Define a Project plan
Always ask these questions for a plan:

1) What?
2) Who?
3) When?

## 3_) Schedule and Milestones
Set small milestones and schedule them that will help you to go step by step.

## 4_) Manage project on progress

Some of the things that we need to keep in mind:

- Communicate Progress and Risk
- Communicate work that is happening
- Individual status
- Not micromanage, but know where you are and what is blocking you

## 5) Reflection or Retrospective
At the end of a iteration ask yourself (or team):

- What went well?
- What can be improved?

And also:
- Create a template for a next project
- Celebrate goal!

# Course #2: Productivity Habits That Stick

I like this course, because the mentor started explaining what is productivity,
from his perspective:

```
productivity = intention + attention
```

**Intention.-** The things that drive you, list them.
**Attention.-** Focus on the things that are on your list. Do the right things at the
right time.

> Approach first, act second.

# Applyting both of them to my daily life
There are many things that have my intento and attention right now:

- Guitar
- Health
- Foreign language
- Soft skills
- Tech skills

# Awareness
Know about your _intentions_ and beign in touch with them. So that you can put
more _attention_ to them.

How to build awareness?
## Capture relentlessly
> Capture everything, regret nothing.
Clarity.- Put what's in your mind in some place that you trust. As often, as you can.

## Slow down
Grab a sheet of paper and just capture your thoughts. Brainstorm.

> Speed the right things up, and slow the right things down.

# Conclussion
You can find interesting courses for free in Shareskills, so give it a try and I
hope they work for you, so far they have been helpful for me. :)
