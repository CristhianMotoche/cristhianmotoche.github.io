title: Sorting algorithms (written in Haskell)
---
This is going to be my first blog post, so I decided to do
something basic about sorting algorithms written in Haskell.
I hope you like it, and please give me all your feedback (about
technical stuff, typographical error, and so on).

So, lets start, shall we?

The classical (but unneficient) Bubble Sort. To understand
it, think about bubbles (even the economic ones). The bigger
the bubble is, the higher it goes.
