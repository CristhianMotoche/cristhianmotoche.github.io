description: Comparing the Type Narrowing of TypeScript and Python
---

In thi post, I plan to compare the ways TypeScript and Python do Type Narrowing. Let's start with the definition of Type Narrowing:

Type Narrowing is a mechanism used to deduce and narrow down the type of a variable, expression, or set of values based on certain conditions or operations.
It allows the type checker to infer a more specific type rather than one that is more general at the beginning. The inference is often achieved by analyzing
the control flow, branches, or conditional statements within the code.
