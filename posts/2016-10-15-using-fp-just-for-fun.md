description: Why I decided to use Functional Programming languages just for fun and focusing on other languajes to survive
---
I was an intern for a company that does Functional Programming with Haskell. It was awesome!
However, I quit (a terrible decision) for some personal reasons.

In a brief research, I found that this company is the only one that does FP in my country.
Unfourtunately, I still being a junior developer (and a student) so I can't afford to apply
to a job in [functional jobs](https://functionaljobs.com/) like a freelancer.

So, I'll have to put my interest in FP languages aside.

First, because I need to find a part-time job to help my parents and finishing my studies. But,
in my country the programming languages that are more required are Java, PHP, C#, and JavaScript.
I don't think they are bad, of course they have their drawbacks like any language,
and also because choosing language is just like
[choosing your favorite color](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/05/21/BlueNoYellow.html).
But, I'll have to improve in some of them so I can found a job.
Not in programming languages like Haskell, Scala, PureScript, Clojure, and so on.

Second, even if continue learning more about functional programming languages.
I'll never be able to use them until I become a really good functional programmer,
and also there is going to be a small group of companies where I could work.

That is why I'll use FP just for fun, and I'll be focusing more in Object Oriented
programming languages. Otherwise, I'll be starving. :P

This is a personal thought. May I'm wrong, but as I see that is my only solution.
If you want to comment. Go ahead!
