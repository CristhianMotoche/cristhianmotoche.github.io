Yesteday, I got the movitation to start writing again. However, I didn't think
what I was going to write about. .\_. Yeah, that usually happens to me. However,
I'm going to try really hard this time to start writing, I promise. So, I have
some ideas in mind right now:

1) A few days ago, I created a website for my dad using a free template. However,
the page by itself doesn't help at all. So, I think I should start doing some
Community Management (CM) for my dad. Although, my knowledge about CM is kind of
limited, because I've been a programmer most of the time.

2) As I mentioned in the previous blog, I have to redesign all of this site. So,
I was thinking that that could be another topic for the blog. I'll try to describe my
journey redesigning this site.

3) Also, as I mentioned in the previos blog, I want to add some random posts, not
related to technology or my career, but about the things I like. So, I was thinking
about adding a blog about my favorite scenes in TV shows, my ideas about being
productive, etc., etc., etc. You may don't want to read this part. :)

Okay, that's all for today! I'll try to write a little bit more tomorrow!

ByE!
