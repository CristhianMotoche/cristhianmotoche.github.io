description: Placeholder may not be a good practice... from an accessibility point of view
---

This time I heard something that I didn't expect so I decided to research a little bit more about it.

# Steps 21-30, 31-40

* `placeholder` may not be a good practice from an accessibility point of view since users could believe that a field is already filled
or prepopulated and they may submit the form without filling some fields. `label`s should be the only ones describing an element:

```html
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input id="name" type="text" placeholder="Cristhian Motoche" />
```

* CSS plays an important role in accessibility, too. For example:
  - It could hide some text that can be read only by assistive techonologies.

```html
<style>
#dob {
  display: none;
}
</style>

<label for="name">D.O.B. <p id="dob">(Date of birth)</p>:</label>
<input id="name" type="text" />
```


  - The `before` pseudo-element along with `content:` to dinamically generate numerated content

```html
<style>
p:before {
  content: 'Question #';
}
</style>

<p></p>
<p></p>
```

# Spets 40 to the end

The fifth video presents some of the things that we already learn and it seems
the last video in the playlist is missing. Therefore, I would consider this playlist
done! I learned a very little bit of accessibility so I plan to keep learning
more about it in another ocassion. Now, what I want to do next is schedule and
organize the things to learn on each month of this year rather than taking a topic
randomly.
