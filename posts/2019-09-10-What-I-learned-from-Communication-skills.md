# Motivation
I want to improve my communication skills so that I can become more productive
and effective during meetings or talks. Therefore, I decided to look for courses
or readings about it. I found this [YouTube playlist][yt-playlist] and I think
it's a good start.

# Development of the course
## 01. Introduction
In the first video, Richard Garnett compares communication with baseball. There
are some bases that you need to go around before getting into the speking part:

1st) **Trust** this comes down to:
- Competence.- Does people know what they're talking about?
- Character.- Does people say what they are going to do?
- Relationships.- __People buy People__. What is you level of relationship?

2nd) **Understand**.- You need to LISTEN and EMPATHIZE.
The more you listen, the more you're able to go the next base:

3rd) **Be understood**.- Our ability to persudate others depends on our ability to
understand them, which is given by the trust that we have between each other.

Ways to be understood:

- Write to people
- \* Speack to people

4th) **Act**.- At the end of a conversation, we want people to CHANGE to ACT in a
different way. But, there are some barriers that we need to overcome in order
to do this.

Now that we know the bases, you need to identify in which of them we need help
and we should start working on fixing that. For example, if you want to be
better at understanding, you can do a `10/90` conversation. You talk only a 10%
and the other person talks 90%.

## 02. Barriers of effective communication
