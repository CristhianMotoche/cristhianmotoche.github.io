Hi, dear reader! (Is anyone else than me reading this? :thinking-face:)
I decided to finally invest some time on this blog post. I've been spending my
time in so many worthless things. So, it's finally time do invest some time here.
I'm going to write about lots of things. I'm a software developer, but that's
just one things I do, it's not who I am. In this blog, I hope to reflect who I
really am. Or, probably not, I don't know. But, first things first. I think, I
need to finish a few things in this site:

- [  ] Redesign a little bit (yeah, the site looks like a website from the 90's).
- [  ] Schedule in my calendar times to write. I'd probaly do it on the weekend or maybe 30 min. a day.

Ok, that's all for today. See you next post! ByE!
