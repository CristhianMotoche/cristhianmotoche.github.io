I've been feeling a little bit overwhelmed with what should I learn next. Let me explain,
I like learning and practicing new stuff but I won't be able to learn forever
and I won't be able to apply everything I learn either. Therefore, I think it's
necessary to be selective with the things to learn next. I wish I could learn
forever and use the knowledge that I acquiere but I need to be realistic and
prioritize my learning.

A new year is about to begin and I want to start with something fresh. I plan to
choose a topic, organize the things to learn about it, and start learning! No more
excuses and no more delays! I'll list the things to learn, prioritize them and choose
one for 2024. Ok, here I go:

List (unordered):

* Advanced Web Development (e.g. accessibility, performance optimization, progressive web apps, browser extensions, etc.)
* Advanced Mobile Development (e.g. mobile animations, data synchronization, security and privacy, etc.)
* Data Science (e.g. data maniputaion, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.)
* Artificial Intelligence (e.g. deep learning, computer vision, etc.)
* DevOps (e.g. escalability, observability, telemetry, etc.)

Now (ordered based on my preference):

1. Advanced Web Development (e.g. accessibility, performance optimization, progressive web apps, browser extensions, etc.)
1. Artificial Intelligence (e.g. deep learning, computer vision, etc.)
1. Advanced Mobile Development (e.g. mobile animations, data synchronization, security and privacy, etc.)
1. Data Science (e.g. data maniputaion, machine learning, natural language processing, etc.)
1. DevOps (e.g. escalability, observability, telemetry, etc.)

Ok, let's go that way and that's it!

I'll stop overthinking and I'll start reviewing new things in that order.

Ok, bye!
