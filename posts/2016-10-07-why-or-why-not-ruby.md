# Why?
- Really easy to code.
- Easy to understand and mantein.
- One of the most powerfull web frameworks: **Ruby On Rails**
- A large community for support.

# Why not?
- Difficult to debug. However, you can use a gem like **byebug**.
- In general, I don't like dynamic languages because I can get errors at runtime.
